## Getting Started

This is a demo project for Mikromedia Plus for STM32F7 board by Mikroelektronika. Project was built using following ecosystem:

- STMCubeMX (4.27.0) & STM32CubeF7 (1.12.0) initialization code generator by STMicroelectronics
- System Workbench for STM32 â€“ SW4STM32 (v2.6) IDE by AC6
- STemWin - graphical stack library by Segger
- mikroBootloader - for programing MCU with a preloaded USB-HID bootloader
